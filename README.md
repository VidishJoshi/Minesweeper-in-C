# Minesweeper-in-C
A basic project written in C which implements the popular game MINESWEEPER.

##Getting Started
This is a C project. All you need to have is GCC compiler pre-installed in your system. Just download this project and and you are ready to go.

### Prerequisites
C Compiler on your system

##Running the Tests
This is a menu driven project whose output will be shown in the terminal window only. It has easy to understand UI, so much thought is not needed to be given to run the tests. Just follow the options on your screen :)

##Contribution
Contributions are welcome.

##Amendments needed
### The Collapsing of Tiles features :

One of the interesting feature of this game - 

Whenever the player hits a tile with the number 0 behind it, it should collapse all the neighbouring tiles around it till it find tiles with nn-zero number behind them.

This is not yet installed in this game. 

It would be great for this project to have that feature.
