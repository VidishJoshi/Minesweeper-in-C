## Amendments needed
### The Collapsing of Tiles features :

One of the interesting feature of this game - 

Whenever the player hits a tile with the number 0 behind it, it should collapse all the neighbouring tiles around it till it find tiles with non-zero number behind them.

This is not yet coded in this game. 

It would be great for this project to have that feature.
