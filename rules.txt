                                                RULES:

1)A square matrix will be shown to the player. Its size will be determined by the
 level of difficulty selected by the player.

2)The primary goal is to not open a square with a mine in it.

3)One may open any square by writing the numbered location of that square.

4)All the matrix are numbered from 0 to n both for rows and for columns
(where n is the sixe of the matrix).

5)A standard input consists of 3 integer numbers.

6)If the player wants to open a box, then he has to press 1 and if the player wants
 to flag a mine, then he has press 2 at the end of entering the co-ordinates.

7)The first two input numbers are co-ordinates and the third is a number which is either 
  1 or 2.

         FOR EXAMPLE: 1 3 1
  It means that the co-ordinate is (1,3) and the player wants to open the box.

8)Based on the number shown when each square is opened, one has to deduce the possible 
  positions of a mine and has to mark that position.

9)When a player has marked the positions of all of the bombs, the player wins the game.

10)If any player opens up a square containing  a mine, the player loses the game.
